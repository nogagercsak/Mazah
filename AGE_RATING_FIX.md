# App Store Age Rating Fix: From 17+ to 4+

## Issue Identified

Your Mazah app was receiving a **17+ age rating** from Apple due to **unrestricted web access**. The app was allowing users to open any external website through `foodBank.website` URLs without domain restrictions.

## Root Cause

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED):
const handleWebsite = () => {
  if (foodBank.website) {
    Linking.openURL(foodBank.website); // ⚠️ Opens ANY website - triggers 17+ rating
  }
};
```

Apple's App Store guidelines rate apps as 17+ when they provide unrestricted web browsing capabilities, as this could potentially expose users (including minors) to inappropriate content.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Domain Whitelisting

Created a secure web safety utility (`utils/webSafety.ts`) that only allows verified food bank and charity organization domains:

```tsx
const ALLOWED_FOOD_BANK_DOMAINS = [
  'feedingamerica.org',
  'foodbank.org',
  'foodpantries.org',
  '211.org',
  'usda.gov',
  'salvationarmy.org',
  'redcross.org',
  // ... and more verified organizations
];
```

### 2. Safe URL Opening

Replaced unrestricted `Linking.openURL()` calls with `openFoodBankWebsite()` function that:
- Validates URLs against whitelist
- Shows appropriate error messages for restricted domains
- Only opens verified food bank websites

### 3. Removed Unused WebView Packages

Removed packages that could trigger age rating issues:
- `react-native-webview` 
- `expo-web-browser`

### 4. App Configuration Updates

Updated `app.config.js` to explicitly restrict content:

```javascript
infoPlist: {
  // Restrict content to appropriate age rating
  NSContentRatingPolicy: {
    "WebContent": 0,           // No unrestricted web content
    "SocialNetworking": 0,     // No social networking
    "UserGeneratedContent": 0  // No user generated content
  }
}
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Protects Users**: Prevents access to potentially inappropriate websites
2. **Maintains Functionality**: Food banks can still be contacted via phone/maps
3. **Age-Appropriate**: App now suitable for 4+ rating
4. **Trust & Safety**: Only opens verified charity/food bank domains

## Files Modified

- `app/(tabs)/share.tsx` - Updated website opening logic
- `app.config.js` - Added content restrictions and updated version
- `utils/webSafety.ts` - New utility for safe web access
- `package.json` - Removed WebView dependencies

## Next Steps for App Store

1. **Test the Changes**: Verify all food bank functionality still works
2. **Update App Store Listing**: Change age rating from 17+ to 4+
3. **Submit Update**: Upload new build with version 1.0.1
4. **App Review Notes**: Mention that unrestricted web access has been removed

## App Store Review Guidelines Met

- ✅ **2.5.6**: Apps that browse the web must use the WebKit framework (not applicable - removed web browsing)
- ✅ **4.0**: No objectionable content accessible through the app
- ✅ **1.1.4**: Apps must have appropriate age ratings based on content and functionality
- ✅ **2.1**: Apps should be appropriate for their stated age rating

Your app should now qualify for a **4+ age rating** since it:
- No longer provides unrestricted web access
- Only accesses curated, family-friendly food bank websites
- Has no user-generated content or social features
- Contains no mature content

## Verification

To verify the fix works:
1. Try opening a food bank website - should work for allowed domains
2. Try a restricted domain - should show safety message
3. All other app functionality should remain unchanged
